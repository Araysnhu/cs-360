*Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The goal of the app I create was to make a space where users could input their current weight and create an ultimate weight goal that they would like to get down on a timeframe of their choosing. The users needed to be able to access, view, and change if they needed to their weight at the time, the weight that the wish to reach, the date that they started, and any additional notes that they wished to aid them in their journey. By having all of this information in the same place and readily available the users’ weight loss journeys could be made much easier.

*What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

I needed a login page that could recognize usernames and passwords for personalized experiences and privacy, I needed a create account page for users to be able to create the login information that would be used for the login page, I needed to create a display page that showed users input information like weight, weight goal, date, and extra info, I needed to create a page that users could access in order to update the display page with current information, and I needed to create a sms confirmation page that asked if users wished to sign up to receive notifications. My designs for these pages understood that many of our users would be new to their weight loss journeys and a bit apprehensive, so I kept everything simple and straightforward without too much information or clutter on any of the screens. I only included the essentials, which I feel was successful in.

*How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

I had each one of my Java classes draw from the appropriate corresponding xml classes by using the “Resource” (R.) command and pinpointing where the xml class was located (the layout file) and what the specific name of the class was. By enabling my Java classes to draw from the xml classes I was able to turn the otherwise static pages into a fully functioning application. In the future what I learned about being able to create corresponding Java classes and have those connect to the xml classes will prove instrumental and make things much simpler, and this is because like I did with my project, I can first create and design the static xml pages to my liking, and simply acclimate the Java classes in later to bring about the functionality of the already existing xml classes.

*How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

I tested my code by first checking the problems tab to see what issues were coming up and how severe they were. This helped me address any issues that would have otherwise prevented the app from functioning properly if at all. Once I was satisfied I ran the app on an emulator to make sure it could function, and if I ran into any problems that would cause that app to quit unexpectedly I checked the logcat tab for any “Fatal Errors” and then I went into my code and corrected those errors and ran the app again, then rinse and repeat.

*Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

My biggest was the initial failure of my Java classes to recognize my Resource inputs, but after some trial and error of repeatedly trying to clean and rebuild by looking at the options provided my Quick Fix options I realized I forgot to import the Resource for my Weight Track App to draw from, so I imported the com.example.weighttrackapp.R to be able to draw from what I needed.

*In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I feel like the best aspect of my mobile app was the ability for it to intake input on a new users username and password, and draw upon that input to log that specific user in. I was also able to obstruct the password into dots like we learned in a previous module, and I feel like in these aspects of the application I was able to draw on the greatest amount of knowledge and experience from what I learned in the course.
